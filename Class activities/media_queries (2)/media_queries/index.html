      <p>My name is Sabeen Zehra. By education I am an electrical Engineer but learning to code and make magic through websites at the moment.
        I have worked as in various engingeering companies in different capacities. I worked in Siemens Engineering Company as an Intern. There I worked 
        on ERPs and gained some knowledge on how SAP works. </p>

      <p>I also got some great work experience while working for Emirates International Airlines in UAE,Dubai. I always feel very passionately about technology
        and it never dissapoints me as well. Its a mutual understanding you can say.I have 3 beautiful children who are the source of immense joy and motivation in all aspects of my life. They teach me something new everyday and I am so 
        grateful to have my amazing family in my life.</p>
